  long:'I want to tackle the food waste on campus. At the end of the day, all the food left over on the food stalls which is still in good conditions to be consumed could be repurposed, instead of being just thrown away. We could establish a collection time window in which these foods are sold at a discount or even donated, to prevent them from ending in the bin.',
  need:'Code & platform design: I need the specific platform to operate and execute the idea. It could take the form of an APP that sends students a message when there is leftover food ready for collection. Students who receive the message could be able to accept the request on a FCFS basis and walk physically to the food stall to collect it within the timeframe provided.',

My previous professional career has enabled be to experience sustainability from a close standpoint and this has enabled me to more proactively initiate conversations around this topic. Now, in Singapore, I see an opportunity to further continue those conversations and hopefully generate more impact and contribute to a more sustainable world.',

The remaining value in our waste could be split up for example into plastics, biodegradables, paper and much more. This way, the materials could all be recycled much more effectively, according to their individual remaining utility. ',
